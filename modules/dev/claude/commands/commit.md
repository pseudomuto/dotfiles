Commit without co-author or mentioning claude. I'd like to preview the commit message before it is applied. We should
avoid the words `comprehensive`, and focus on the main portion of the work being done in cases where multiple things
have happened. Commit messages should include a meaningful first line, and a brief description of the problem/solution
before the bulletpoints.
